#### create a docs folder and lets iterate on a design for snow-maker  

To start designing the documentation for "snow-maker," we will create a `docs` folder and add an initial design document. This document will outline the basic structure and components of the project. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Create a `docs` directory.
2. Add a `design.md` file within the `docs` directory to outline the initial design.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to create the `design.md` file:

docs/design.md
```markdown
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
# Snow-Maker Design Document

## Overview
Snow-Maker is a project aimed at creating artificial snow using advanced technology. This document outlines the initial design and architecture of the system.

## Components
1. **Snow Generation Unit**: The core component responsible for producing snow.
2. **Control System**: Manages the operation of the snow generation unit.
3. **Monitoring System**: Provides real-time data and analytics on snow production.

## Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each component is designed to be modular and easily replaceable.
- **Scalability**: The system is designed to scale with increased demand.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with weather data for optimized snow production.
- Mobile app for remote monitoring and control.

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You can create the `docs` directory and add the `design.md` file with the following shell command:

```bash
mkdir docs && touch docs/design.md
```

This will set up the initial structure for the documentation of the "snow-maker" project. Let me know if you want to add more details or make any changes!

=======
## Overview
Snow-Maker is a Python wrapper for Snowflake, designed to streamline the configuration and provisioning of Snowflake components programmatically. By abstracting complex operations into simple configurations, Snow-Maker enables developers to efficiently manage Snowflake resources, automate workflows, and integrate seamlessly with existing data pipelines.

## Ideas for Development
- **Configuration as Code**: Implement a declarative approach to define Snowflake resources using configuration files.
- **Automation Tools**: Develop CLI tools to automate common tasks such as schema creation, data loading, and query execution.
- **Integration Support**: Provide integration capabilities with popular data processing frameworks and orchestration tools.
- **Extensibility**: Design a plugin system to allow custom extensions and integrations.
- **Security Features**: Incorporate robust security measures, including role-based access control and data encryption.
