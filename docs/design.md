# Snow-Maker Design Document

## Overview
Snow-Maker is a Python wrapper for Snowflake, designed to simplify the definition and provisioning of Snowflake components programmatically through configuration. This document outlines the initial design and architecture of the system.

## Components
1. **Snow Generation Unit**: The core component responsible for producing snow.
2. **Control System**: Manages the operation of the snow generation unit.
3. **Monitoring System**: Provides real-time data and analytics on snow production.

## Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each component is designed to be modular and easily replaceable.
- **Scalability**: The system is designed to scale with increased demand.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with weather data for optimized snow production.
- Mobile app for remote monitoring and control.
