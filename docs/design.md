# Snow-Maker Design Document

## Project Setup

### Directory Structure
- `docs/`: Contains design documents and other documentation.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the Snow-Maker Python wrapper.
- `tests/`: Contains test cases and testing framework setup.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files for defining Snowflake resources.
- `scripts/`: Contains CLI tools and automation scripts.

### Dependencies
- Use a `requirements.txt` file to list Python dependencies, including the Snowflake Python SDK.
- Consider using a virtual environment for dependency management.

### Version Control
- Use Git for version control, with a clear branching strategy (e.g., `main`, `develop`, feature branches).

### CI/CD
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.

## Overview
Snow-Maker is a Python wrapper for Snowflake, designed to streamline the configuration and provisioning of Snowflake components programmatically. By abstracting complex operations into simple configurations, Snow-Maker enables developers to efficiently manage Snowflake resources, automate workflows, and integrate seamlessly with existing data pipelines.

## Ideas for Development
- **Configuration as Code**: Implement a declarative approach to define Snowflake resources using configuration files.
- **Automation Tools**: Develop CLI tools to automate common tasks such as schema creation, data loading, and query execution.
- **Integration Support**: Provide integration capabilities with popular data processing frameworks and orchestration tools.
- **Testing**: Implement a robust testing framework to validate configurations and changes before deployment.
- **Extensibility**: Design a plugin system to allow custom extensions and integrations.
- **Security Features**: Incorporate robust security measures, including role-based access control and data encryption.

## Configurable Components
- **Databases**: Manage and configure databases to store and organize data.
- **Schemas**: Define schemas within databases to structure data.
- **Tables**: Create and manage tables to store data records.
- **Views**: Set up views for specific data perspectives.
- **Roles**: Configure roles for access control and permissions.
- **Users**: Manage user accounts and authentication.
- **Warehouses**: Provision and manage virtual warehouses for compute resources.
- **Resource Monitors**: Set up resource monitors to track and control resource usage.
- **Tasks**: Automate and schedule tasks for data processing.
- **Streams**: Implement streams for change data capture.
- **Pipes**: Configure pipes for continuous data loading.
- **File Formats**: Define file formats for data import/export.
- **Stages**: Manage stages for data loading and unloading.
- **Network Policies**: Set up network policies for security and access control.
- **Snowflake Core Artifacts**: Enable the creation and management of essential Snowflake components such as databases, roles, warehouses, and general RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
- **Testing and Validation**: Provide tools to test and validate changes to Snowflake configurations, ensuring reliability and consistency.
- **Deployment with Certainty**: Facilitate a seamless deployment process that allows users to apply changes with confidence.

## Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each component is designed to be modular and easily replaceable.
- **Scalability**: The system is designed to scale with increased demand.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with weather data for optimized snow production.
- Mobile app for remote monitoring and control.
